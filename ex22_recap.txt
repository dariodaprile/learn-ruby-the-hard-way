Concepts:
Hard coding => putting data that should come from the user as a string right in our program.

Functions:
def end
arguments in the function
*=> not difined number


Methods:
puts => print the resoult
string_interpolation #{} => insert data in a string
format_string => "%d" %decimal || "%s" %string
print => print results on the same line
gets.chomp => get imput and cut last line
require => call libraries
File.open(filename)=> open external file
read => read file
close => try to close to avoid memory leak
readline
truncate =>Empties the file
write => write inthe file

---- exemple----
target = File.open(filename, 'w')
target.truncate(target.size)
target.write(line1)


script = $0 => get the name of the script (programme)

Escape sequences:
\n between elements=> print element on multiple lines
\t => paragraph
 <<NAME => create string


libraries :
'open-uri'


argument variable ARGV => it's a variable used to pass parameters to a script (script it's the .rb file).
STDIN.gets => by the default gets method takes data from ARGV. STDIN aovoid this.
